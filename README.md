All the credits go to: https://github.com/uhShino - the person I took the original raid_clothes file from!

The only things that I've changed were the html, css, lua (on server-side) and modified some functions from javascript.
All others files are from **uhShino**!



Pay him a visit, he does pretty cool stuff!
